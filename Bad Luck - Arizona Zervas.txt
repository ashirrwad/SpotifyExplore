These days they put my song into a playlist
Feels like every single night I'm on vacation
Hit the store and cop a bottle then I face it
Skip the line at every club they prolly think we famous
Woke up with a baddy bro I swear she stupid thick
That girl call me daddy but I swear she ain't my kid
Whippin in the Caddy Gucci purse up on her hip
She fly me to Miami just to party on the strip
Might just spend some bands up on rodeo
With a couple white girls who love to sniff the yayo
Got me a latina and she think my music fuego
She asked me to smash it I'm like "Okay if you say so"
Feel like I got the world up in my palm
And my crib it got the trees with the palm
I stay with my crews like I'm Tom
Send a little money to my moms, yeah yeah yeah

And now I'm feelin okay
Cause things are finally going my way
Bitch you better learn my name
I had some bad luck but now I'm feelin good

Off the henny and I'm feelin good, yeah
Took too many and I'm feelin good, yeah
Run the town and now I'm feelin good, yeah
I was down but now I'm feelin good
Off the henny and I'm feelin good, yeah
Took too many and I'm feelin good, yeah
Run the town and now I'm feelin good, yeah
I was down but now I'm feelin good

You check my wrists and see this ain't the same page
And the ambition nothing gets in my way
Listen to the system Woody 'F' the new wave
This is not a mission we do this shit erry day
One look at the fit now they want my business
She's a Misses but I stay persistent
It's just different I need an assistant
Batting average brazy and my hits consistent
Kentucky boy and Arizona with some YOK hoes
You think you're ahead you're like a mile back bro
It's just adding up, it sound like my cash flow
That's my digit dirty so no I'm an asshole
I'm not fallin for it, used to never hit me back and now she callin for it
I'm not fallin for it, things are looking up bitch I know you heard the chorus yeah yeah
