I got a little bit of bad
I'm trying to make it stretch
The way I'm wearing prada
Its like its swinging from my neck
Smile on my face
Your misses want a taste
She give me piece of mind every time she give me brain
Swear I'm one hell of a guy
Let's make the most of time
How you really living if you never feel alive
She just looked me in my eyes
But gave me no reply, I said shit
You can waist your life, just don't waste my time

There's, bullshit on the radio
Talk'n bout shit they don't do
Trap music, that's blaring down the hallways
Turning up when we want to, yeah
Mamas' yell'n like, why you never call me
Don't you know that I love you
Trap music, that's blaring down the hallways
Turning up when we want to, yeah

I done dropped out of college
Never thought I would be a rapper
Linked up with a baller
Then I left the fuck'n atmosphere
Tried to tell a nigga, wait up
Tell 'em I'm done waiting
Dishing out these mufuckin hits
Then serving niggas like waiters
Couldn't even imitate me
These niggas heads inflated
How you hold it down
Ego bigger than the great lakes is
I been lost my patients
My life like so amazing, yes it is
I hated yours, they showed me love

There's, bullshit on the radio
Talk'n bout shit they don't do
Trap music, that's blaring down the hallways
Turning up when we want to, yeah
Mamas' yell'n like, why you never call me
Don't you know that I love you
Trap music, that's blaring down the hallways
Turning up when we want to, yeah

You know being me is easy
That's the only thing I can be
Fulfilling dreams is easy too
And that's all you got in reach
I'm a get what's mine
I won't take no time
Oh no
Yeah, its easy to forget these things when

There's, bullshit on the radio
Talk'n bout shit they don't do
Trap music, that's blaring down the hallways
Turning up when we want to, yeah
Mamas' yell'n like, why you never call me
