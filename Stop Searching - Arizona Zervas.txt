Yeah, AZ
You can tell 'em to stop searching now
Yeah, uh

You can feed me any beat
And I'll show you I can do it
Put it on a plate and I'll show you I can chew it
I don't lie on raps, boy I only spit the truest
And I heard they throwing shade
But I can never tell who threw it
Bunch of bubblegum rappers
Acting like they big league
Winter fresh cold
I can chew these beats like wringley
I really got the drive
I shift vibes like a sixth speed
And I've always been a rebel
Kinda like that ole Miss Team
Its no discussion
Boy, I really got the hits now
Couldn't stand these fakes
So I had to go and sit down
Remember when you hated
I could prolly steal your bitch now
She's like an old phone I turn her on and then she flips out
Big bars yeah you know I got the word play
My verses live in hearses I could kill you on my worst day
Working in the studio trapped up like a bird cage
Counting my digits
I'm 'bout my cake like a Birthday
Young man, I go and get what I want
And can't nobody touch me, cause I'm second to none
Go and put me near these rappers
I'm the best of the bunch
And every feature I get on
Is just a check and some lunch
Homie wait till I'm poppin'
Tell these fakes I ain't stoppin'
They probably thought I was an author
With the way that I'm plottin'
I got moves to make
I got some rules to break
I got some brain to take in
Just like my schoolin' days
It was 2013
Spent everyday at detention
I was busy writin' lyrics, wasn't payin' attention
Now your boy is on tour
And gettin' paid for expressin'
And your girl is front row
I swear she stay in my mentions
Fuck boy, don't at me
I run it like an athlete
My patience runs thin
Like an anorexic track team
Its no different, I still do it cause I love it
But I know I'm still outstandin'
Like you do when your clubbin'
Cause lately I feel like the greatest
I ain't worried 'bout haters
I feel like I've been on a roll
Like I been hangin' with skaters
I got some liquor and chasers
These girlies are flippin' like gainers
I might be balling out in Cali like I play for the Lakers
I hit that swish, I've been grindin'
You know my clique's so iconic
I just been switching up my climate
These labels wishing I would sign it
I got a lot up on my mind
But I ain't stressin' these hoes
Only thing I'm focused on is
My success and my goals
I need a brand new whip
I need a 30 City Tour
I need a line up the street
Leadin' up to the door
I need that double XL
So go and tell them who deserve it
Arizona Zervas
Now they can stop searching
Bitch
