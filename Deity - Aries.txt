Stay up, shake me out
Take your time, I'll wait it out
Player, player
All these ghosts don't phase me now
Make 80 thou, no carry outs
Stay in a tent, let's wear it out
Focus, beside me now, on her knees

Be a deity, enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You'll say, you're a deity, you're a deity (mmm)

Enjoy my fake love for one night
Hang on, I'll save you, you wish
That were the case, yeah
Yeah, I like, I don't mind, I don't mind
Probably off on him, take all this
Only thing that I beg for is your pardon
One thing, don't feed off of the gossip
'Cause all that talk is still talking
And when that's up, we can't knock it
Look at all this crop we made off it
I can't reach, but I lost
I'm a fiend, for you

Be a deity, enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You'll say, yeah, I might find me a deity
Enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You'll say, be a deity

Stay up, shake me out
Take your time, I'll wait it out
Player, player
All these ghosts don't phase me now
Calm the fire, hate me, facing some time
Weight on my shoulders
Breaking, on her knees

Be a deity, enemy, no telling why you're failing me
You'll say, yeah, I might find me a deity

Be a deity
