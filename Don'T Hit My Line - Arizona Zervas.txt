Oh they wanna talk now, let em move they lips (lips)
Coming at my neck and, they talking all that shit (shit)
I ain't really tripping no, I ain't got the time (time)
But when I blow up, bitch please don't hit my line
Don't hit my line
Don't hit my line (don't hit my line)
Don't hit my line (don't hit my line)
Don't hit my line (don't hit my line)
Don't hit my line

Oh ain't that funny when I'm down they just lay low
Oh now ain't it funny they my friend when they say so
Watch em' come around when I pull up in that range though
Watch em' come around I start stacking all these pasos
If I like that shit, I gon' top that shit

If I like that shit, then I invite that bitch
Then I sex her down until she cum

Tucked that shit [?] then you might get slapped

I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya but you bitches never listen
I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya that your boy been on a mission
I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya but they couldn't see the vision
I tried to tell ya, I tried to tell ya now look what you've been missin
