Living like a race
Ain't no sign of stopping I'm on pace
I can see them plottin' it ain't safe
She know that I got it on the way
Told her get up out my face
I need diamonds on my face
Only came for the baddies and the drinks
Gettin' bands give a fuck 'bout what you think
Watch what happens when I give a little wink
Clean money got her hands up on the sink

And she know
We been living fast
Homie we ain't going slow
Foot up on the gas
When I'm whippin' through the coast
We don't go to class
But you know we honer roll
Yea you know we honer roll
That might be the molly in her cup
She just put the taste up to my tongue
Now she prolly thinking I'm the one
Told her pour another drink
Then I sip it till it's done

Gettin' bands give a fuck 'bout what you think
Watch what happens when I give a little wink
Clean money got her hands up on the sink

And I'm on one
If I sipping on it, it's a strong one
She just seen the check and it's a long one
If I take her home then it's a home run
Hit it like a home run (This ball is crushed)
She a bad thing
We might get it poppin' in the backseat
Out in Hollywood but we ain't acting
Running up the money like a track team
